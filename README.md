# Getting to Philosophy 

## Intro
Do you know the myth of Wikipedia? Rumor says that clicking on the first link in the main text of a Wikipedia link in the main text of a Wiki page, and then repeating the same for subsequent articles, would always lead you to the philosophy article. As by 2016, 97% of all articles in Wiki led to the article of Philosophy and the average path length was 23.
